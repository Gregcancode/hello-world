# hello-world
my first project on Github.

Hello all! I am Greg and I am coming back to code after a two year hiatus. I previously worked for an affiliate marketing company directly out of college as an Engineer and I struggled with js frameworks that were in use there (jquery, node, express, ES6 etc.) I am starting this journey to become confident and competent within my code and also learn the ins and outs of git to be able to manage my work.
